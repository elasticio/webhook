# webhook-component

> WebHook _component template_ for the [elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io "elastic.io platform").

This is an open source component template for sending and receiving [WebHooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) on [elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io "elastic.io platform"). You can clone it and change it as you wish. However, **if you plan to deploy it into [elastic.io platform](https://www.elastic.io "elastic.io platform") you must follow sets of instructions to succeed**.

## Before you Begin

Before you can deploy any code into our system **you must be a registered elastic.io platform user**. Please see our home page at [https://www.elastic.io](https://www.elastic.io) to learn how.

> Any attempt to deploy a code into our platform without a registration would fail.

After the registration and opening of the account you must **[upload your SSH Key](http://go2.elastic.io/manage-ssh-keys)** into our platform.

> If you fail to upload you SSH Key you will get **permission denied** error during the deployment.

## Getting Started

After registration and uploading of your SSH Key you can proceed to deploy it into our system. At this stage we suggest you to:
* [Create a team](http://go2.elastic.io/manage-teams) to work on your new component (**required**).
* [Create a repository](http://go2.elastic.io/manage-repositories) where your new component is going to *reside* inside the team that you have just created. For a simplicity you can name your repository **webhook-component**.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/elasticio/webhook-component.git webhook-component

$ cd webhook-component
```
Now you can edit your version of **webhook** and change according to your needs - that is if you know what you are doing. Or you can just ``PUSH``it into our system to see the process in action:

```bash
$ git remote add elasticio your-created-team-name@git.elastic.io:webhook-component.git

$ git push elasticio master
```
Please follow the instruction provided in the [Create a team](http://go2.elastic.io/manage-teams) and [Create a repository](http://go2.elastic.io/manage-repositories) for a success.
